    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><b>BIRDS</b></h3>
    <p1>
        <img src="images/Picture9.jpg"height="150" class="dogs">
        Birds are very intriguing creatures as they can range from birds as small as a Cuban bee hummingbird (about two inches long and a little over 1/20 of an ounce) to as large as an ostrich. 
        While most birds fly, there are some that don't. Birds are amazing and each breed is unique in its own way, particularly when it comes to their relational needs and well-being. 
        Unfortunately, birds can experience sadness and depression just like humans. <br><br> 
        A number of root causes may be responsible for your bird's depression such as an illness (either physical or mental), losing its companion, or increasingly becoming bored. 
        Some signs to help identify if your bird is experiencing depression may include the following: 
        <ul><li>reduced appetite</li><li> becoming increasingly irritable</li><li> aggressive behavior</li><li> songs have a different, more solemn tone</li></ul>Be sure to tell your veterinarian if you see signs of any of these symptoms. 
        Just like many illnesses, identifying and treating the symptoms earlier may drastically increase the lifespan of your birdie.

    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><b>CATS</b></h3>
    <img src="images/Picture7.jpg" height="200" class="dogs">
    Cats were first domesticated around 7500 BCE in the western Asia region and are currently the second most popular domestic pet in the United States. 
    While there are over 60 unique documented cat breeds, care and diet can differ between breeds. 
    However, some diets and practices are generally recommended for the well-being of your fluffy family member regardless of breed.  
    <h4>Zero to Four Weeks</h4>It is important the queen (a term commonly used for a female cat that is either pregnant or nursing) directly nurse her young if possible. 
    Monitor your kitten’s growth closely to make sure its growth rate is progressing steadily. 
    If any kitten is not growing at a sufficient rate, a caretaker might need to feed the kitten directly either with a bottle or a feeding tube. 
    Some reasons why kittens might not gain weight appropriately include the following: <br>
    <ul><li>too many other siblings are competing for mom's milk</li><li> gastrointestinal disease</li><li> environmental conditions such as extreme heat or cold, or unsanitary conditions</li>
    </ul>  
    <h4>Four Weeks to One Year</h4> Kittens can start being introduced to soft wet kitten food typically around three to four weeks after birth. According to the <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/cat-care/cat-nutrition-tips" target="_blank">ASPCA,</a> kittens at this age should eat half to one cup of dry kitten food or six to nine ounces of wet kitten food per day. 
    If your kitten has difficulties eating hard food, a small amount of water can be added to soften the food. Cat food that is optimized for kittens provides the additional nutrients that are needed for growth, energy, and wellness. Depending on the breed, your cat may have different dietary requirements. You should always consult with your veterinarian for recommendations.   
    <h4>One Year to Seven Years</h4> This age is when kittens reach the cat stage and do not need as many nutrients. At this age, their level of activity decreases, and so does their metabolism. 
    It is not recommended to leave food out for the cats all day. Instead, provide food a couple times a day so they eat meals rather than snacking throughout the day. This practice reduces the risk of obesity and other weight-related feline ailments.   
    <h4>Seven Years and More</h4> Much like many living organisms, the body begins to deteriorate and experience a lot of changes. Cats at this age should eat less fats and calories and more quality proteins. 
    This means when you are purchasing packaged foods for your cat, look for food that states a particular protein (such as "salmon") and not just a category (such as fish). 
    This usually means they are byproducts, or combinations, of lesser quality proteins.

    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><b>DOGS</b></h3>
    <img src="images/Picture5.jpg" width="200" height="200" class="dogs">
    The domestic dog is an extremely social animal and offers a diverse variety of choices as there are well over 300 breeds recognized by the World Canine Organization. 
    Adopting a dog offers mutual benefits between dog and owner. Many studies cite the social benefits of having a companion as well as the reduced feelings of loneliness from adopting a dog. 
    Studies even show medical indicators such as reduced blood pressure and improved lipid profiles. 
    If you have a dog, it is important to make sure that you care for your dog; be mindful of what you feed your dog and provide enough opportunities for exercise. 
    In this page, you will find more information about how to care for your pets throughout the various stages of their lives.   
    <h4>Diet & Exercise</h4> Throughout dogs’ lifespans, they should generally be fed fewer meals as they mature. Puppies should be nursed the first two months, then introduced to three meals per day when they are about three to six months years old. 
    Their food intake should be reduced to two meals per day when they are six months to one year old and finally reduced to one meal after they reach one year old. And a dog’s typical body mass is composed of somewhere between 60 and 70 percent water. 
    The <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/dog-care/dog-nutrition-tips" target="_blank">ASPCA,</a>says just a 10 percent decrease in body water can cause illness, and a 15 percent loss can cause death, so make sure you keep your pooch hydrated!<br>   
    Much like humans, dogs need to have a healthy level of activity to keep their organs healthy, as well as sun and fresh air. 
    The minimum recommended time for exercise varies greatly with breed and size differences, but generally a range of 30–120 minutes of exercise is recommended per day! Can you imagine exercising two hours per day? OK, I know that wouldn't bother some of you reading this. But the thought of it to me makes me cringe! And by the way, exercising your dog does not mean you are being challenged to a push-up contest. 
    Brisk walks are OK too! You can also choose from a variety of toys to encourage physical activity; just be sure they are age appropriate and do not pose a choking hazard. Pay careful attention to toys that require supervision.   
    <h4>Grooming & Handling</h4> Keeping your furry family member clean is important to its health. So be sure to brush frequently to reduce the amount of shedding and prevent matted and tangled fur that can prove to be extremely difficult to remove. Check for insects such as ticks and fleas, especially after visiting heavily wooded areas. 
    Bathing is not only important to your dog’s health but can be an exercise depending on how strong willed the dog is. Rinse all of the soap out, as any residual soap can result in a rash. Be sure the soap is formulated for your puppy or dog, since harsh soaps can cause allergic reactions. And as always, be careful how you handle your loved one. No matter the size of your dog, you need to be cautious as you carry your canine. If you have a small dog, then cradle the pup with one hand under the chest and the forearm supporting the back half. 
    If it is a large dog, reach under the belly with both your arms perpendicular to the dog, and use each arm to support the chest and rear as you lift.   
    <h4>Vaccinations & Medications</h4> You should always consult with your veterinarian, but there is a core set of vaccines that are typically recommended. Vaccines that reduce the exposure risk to things such as hepatitis, rabies, and parvovirus. Others may be determined by your vet depending on the environment in which the dog resides. 
    Some of these include Bordetella bronchiseptica, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Leptospira bacteria. <br>
